 It looks like there is an issue with creating the release due to an invalid tag name. The error message suggests that the tag name starts with `refs/`, which is not allowed.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `tag_name` property in the `actions/create-release@v1` action to remove the `refs/` prefix. You can update the line to:
```yaml
tag_name: ${{ github.ref.replace('refs/tags/', '') }}
```
This will remove the `refs/tags/` prefix from the tag name, and use only the version number as the tag name.

Here's the updated workflow with this change:
```yaml
